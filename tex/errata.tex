\label{ch:online}

\paragraph{Software source code}
The latest version the software that has been developed 
as part of this work has the DOI (digital object identifier)
\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4625649}{10.5281/zenodo.4625649}
and can be found under the URL \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4625649}.
Additionally, the main software's development repository is available here: 
\url{https://code.ill.fr/scientific-software/takin/paths},
a mirror of the repository can be found here: 
\url{https://github.com/tweber-ill/ill_mirror-takin2-paths}.
It has furthermore been archived at this address:
\url{https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/?origin_url=https://code.ill.fr/scientific-software/takin/paths}.

The latest version of the software's source code archive (ver-0.9) bears the 
filename ``taspaths-oct21.tar.xz'' and has the SHA-256 \cite{web_sha256sum}
checksum:

Development of the geometry library under \lstinline|./src/libs| and the auxiliary tools under \lstinline|./src/tools| 
was already started in 2020, as preparation for the exam in Algorithmic Geometry, and they 
are therefore based on the course materials \cite{FUH_geo2020}. 
The library and tools were then further developed for this work, their separate code repository is available under 
\url{https://github.com/t-weber/geo}, the software is furthermore registered under the DOI 
\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4297475}{10.5281/zenodo.4297475}.

This software is based on the \textit{tlibs} libraries, which reside in the 
sub-directory \lstinline|./tlibs2|, but are not part of the present thesis.
That library has already been developed since my diploma thesis \cite{DiplomaWeber} 
and my PhD thesis \cite{PhDWeber}, as well as during several software 
projects \cite{Weber2014, Takin2016, Takin2017, Takin2021}.
Its full source code is included in the source archive merely for convenience.
Apart from using the \textit{tlibs} library, several code snippets are further developments
of their counterparts from that library, among these the setup and build scripts for the various
systems, as well as the \textit{OpenGL} renderer.
