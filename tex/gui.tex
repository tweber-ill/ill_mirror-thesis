\chapter{User Interfaces}
\label{ch:gui}

The software has been realised in a modular fashion, it comprises a core
and a library module (see chapter \ref{ch:impl}), which can be easily linked 
into external C++ applications. Such a library usage will be important in the
future when the software will be integrated as a plug-in module to the instrument
control software \textit{NOMAD} \cite{NOMAD} that is employed at the Institut 
Laue-Langevin.

Furthermore, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been implemented for a visual
and interactive representation of the instrument and the underlying algorithms.
The GUI is described in detail in section \ref{sec:gui}.

Finally, the software allows scripting via \textit{Python} \cite{Python}. 
Apart from simply setting up a workflow and plotting the results, the \textit{Python}
interface will allow the usage of the software in \textit{Python}-based instrument
control systems such as \textit{NICOS} \cite{NICOS}, which is used at the 
Forschungsreaktor M\"unchen II (FRM-II). 
Details on the scripting interface can be found in section \ref{sec:scripting}.
